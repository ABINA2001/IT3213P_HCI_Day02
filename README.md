We Designed a working calculator interface
Added buttons for digits (0–9) and basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide
Created a display area to show input and results
Made the buttons interactive using Axure’s event handling features

Features Used in Axure
Shapes and buttons to build the interface layout
OnClick interactions to simulate button clicks
Global variables to store input values
Conditions and cases to handle the logic for calculations
Dynamic panel to update and display the output

We Learned How to use Axure tools to design a real-world application
Creating interactive user interfaces
Managing logic visually through event-based interactions
Understanding the flow of input and output in UI design
